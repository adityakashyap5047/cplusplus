# C++ Project

This repository contains C++ source code and related files. Below you'll find a detailed description, file structure, and instructions on how to compile and run the code.

## Description

This project demonstrates C++ programming concepts, including classes, functions, and standard library usage. It is suitable for beginners and intermediate learners looking to understand C++ project organization and compilation.

## File Structure

```

├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── src/                # Source code files (.cpp)
│   └── main.cpp        # Main entry point
├── include/            # Header files (.h/.hpp)
│   └── example.h       # Example header
├── build/              # Compiled binaries (created after build)
└── Makefile            # (Optional) Build automation file
```

## How to Run C++ Code

### Using Command Line

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd "C:/Users/adity/Desktop/c plus plus"
    ```

2. **Compile the code:**
    ```sh
    g++ src/main.cpp -Iinclude -o build/main.exe
    ```

3. **Run the executable:**
    ```sh
    build\main.exe
    ```

### Using Makefile (Optional)

If a `Makefile` is provided:

```sh
make
build\main.exe
```

## Requirements

- [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) (for Windows)
- Command line access

## Notes

- Place additional `.cpp` files in the `src/` folder and headers in `include/`.
- Update the `Makefile` as needed for new files.
